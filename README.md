2. Open your terminal and navigate to the `nerdy_prototype` folder.
3. Install the required Python packages by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch the Streamlit app by running:
   ```
   streamlit run kevindurkee_app.py
   ```
5. Your browser will open automatically, or you can visit the local URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

**Troubleshooting:**
- If you get a `ModuleNotFoundError`, make sure you installed all requirements and are running the command in the correct folder.
- If Streamlit does not open automatically, copy and paste the provided local URL into your browser.
- If you have issues with file paths, ensure your terminal is in the `nerdy_prototype` directory before running the commands.
